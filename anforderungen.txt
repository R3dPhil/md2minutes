help me create a python exe that uses a modernt html ui. 
In the ui i want to select a mark down source file with its content looking like this:

"Alle da außer x,y,z
Gäste: b
Fehlt: a

X öffnet die Sitzung .....

Abstimmung: 500
# neuer top
....
# sonstiges"

the contents of the md dont need to be displayed on the UI.

after that it should call function that splits for every new top ( marked as #)
starting before the first "#" is the header of the file

now  it should send each section starting with the header to a AI. 
The should transribe (improving readability, grammar and marking spots for possible explainations) 
the section finding a good header, subheaders if needed. The Ai should assume tex format saving each 
section for it self. after that python will combine the sections into one tex.
